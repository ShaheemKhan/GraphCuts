Usage:
Edit the directory of imread() to indicate the path of your test image.
This code is sightly refactored and all functions are modularized so you can use 
Disjoint, Graphcuts for your own project.

Important:
This source code requires OpenCV 2.4.8 or over. 
Edit OpenCV_lib_links.h to use with different version.
